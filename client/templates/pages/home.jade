  h3 Online chess is pretty fun too

  p Sooooo, what if everytime you made a chess move your webcam took a short clip of you, and sent that over to your opponent in gif form along with your move? Pretty fun, eh?

  p Each game becomes more than the sum of its moves (or result) because it can be replayed like a flipbook. Each move is forever tied to an animated gif. What'd you look like at the first move? Checkmate? When you blundered your queen?
